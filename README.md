# Karl Sayagain: Vue.js Version

> A Vue.js project

This web application is a work in progress. Some things that still need to be added are:
- [ ] Do some testing/fixing for non-ff/chrome browsers (safari, opera, etc.)
- [X] Form validation
- [X] Error/success messaging for form
- [X] Legit length of recipes array used to randomly display recipe (so new ones added to firebase will show)
- [ ] Sprucing up, maybe custom styling and not Skeleton
- [ ] Assorted updates informed by usability analysis/testing


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# Or, deploy to github pages
npm run deploy

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
